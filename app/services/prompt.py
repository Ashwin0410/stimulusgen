# The actual Great Dictator speech for reference
CHAPLIN_SPEECH = """I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness - not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish…

Soldiers! don't give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: "the Kingdom of God is within man" - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!"""

# Desiderata by Max Ehrmann (1927) - Gentle wisdom, peaceful acceptance
DESIDERATA_TEXT = """Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.
Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.
Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.
Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy."""


# Excerpts from Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet (1903-1908) - Intimate, philosophical, encouraging
RILKE_LETTERS_TEXT = """From Letter One (Paris, February 17, 1903):

Ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: must I write? Dig into yourself for a deep answer. And if this answer rings out in assent, if you meet this solemn question with a strong, simple "I must," then build your life in accordance with this necessity; your whole life, even into its humblest and most indifferent hour, must become a sign and witness to this impulse.

A work of art is good if it has arisen out of necessity. That is the only way one can judge it.

---

From Letter Two (Viareggio, April 5, 1903):

Of course, you must know that every letter of yours will always give me pleasure, and you must be indulgent with the answer, which will perhaps often leave you empty-handed; for ultimately, and precisely in the deepest and most important matters, we are unspeakably alone; and many things must happen, many things must go right, a whole constellation of events must be fulfilled, for one human being to successfully advise or help another.

---

From Letter Four (Worpswede, July 16, 1903):

I want to beg you, as much as I can, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.

Therefore, dear Sir, love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you. For those who are near you are far away, you write, and this shows that the space around you is beginning to grow vast.

---

From Letter Seven (Rome, May 14, 1904):

It is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult; that something is difficult must be one more reason for us to do it.

It is also good to love: because love is difficult. For one human being to love another human being: that is perhaps the most difficult task that has been entrusted to us, the ultimate task, the final test and proof, the work for which all other work is merely preparation.

This more human love will resemble what we are now preparing painfully and with great struggle: the love that consists in this: that two solitudes protect and border and greet each other.

---

From Letter Eight (Borgebygard, Sweden, August 12, 1904):

You have had many sadnesses, large ones, which passed. And you say that even this passing was difficult and upsetting for you. But please, ask yourself whether these large sadnesses haven't rather gone right through you. Perhaps many things inside you have been transformed; perhaps somewhere, deep inside your being, you have undergone important changes while you were sad.

It seems to me that almost all our sadnesses are moments of tension, which we feel as paralysis because we no longer hear our astonished emotions living. Because we are alone with the unfamiliar presence that has entered us; because everything we trust and are used to is for a moment taken away from us; because we stand in the midst of a transition where we cannot remain standing.

We must accept our reality as vastly as we possibly can; everything, even the unprecedented, must be possible within it. This is in the end the only kind of courage that is required of us: the courage to face the strangest, most unusual, most inexplicable experiences that can meet us.

Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest being, something helpless that wants our love.

So you mustn't be frightened, dear Mr. Kappus, if a sadness rises in front of you, larger than any you have ever seen; if an anxiety, like light and cloud-shadows, moves over your hands and over everything you do. You must realize that something is happening to you, that life has not forgotten you, that it holds you in its hand and will not let you fall.

---

From Letter Nine (Sweden, November 4, 1904):

And as for the rest, let life happen to you. Believe me: life is in the right, always.

And your doubt can become a good quality if you train it. It must become knowing, it must become criticism. Ask it, whenever it wants to spoil something for you, why something is ugly, demand proofs from it, test it, and you will find it perhaps bewildered and embarrassed, perhaps also protesting. But don't give in, insist on arguments, and the day will come when instead of being a destroyer, it will become one of your best workers — perhaps the most intelligent of all the ones that are building your life."""


# Albert Camus Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech (1957) - Moral commitment, artistic duty
CAMUS_NOBEL_SPEECH = """In receiving the distinction with which your free Academy has so generously honoured me, my gratitude has been profound, particularly when I consider the extent to which this recompense has surpassed my personal merits. Every man, and for stronger reasons, every artist, wants to be recognized. So do I. But I have not been able to learn of your decision without comparing its repercussions to what I really am. A man almost young, rich only in his doubts and with his work still in progress, accustomed to living in the solitude of work or in the retreats of friendship: how would he not feel a kind of panic at hearing the decree that transports him all of a sudden, alone and reduced to himself, to the centre of a glaring light?

I felt that shock and inner turmoil. In order to regain peace I have had, in short, to come to terms with a too generous fortune. And since I cannot live up to it by merely resting on my achievement, I have found nothing to support me but what has supported me through all my life, even in the most contrary circumstances: the idea that I have of my art and of the role of the writer.

For myself, I cannot live without my art. But I have never placed it above everything. If, on the other hand, I need it, it is because it cannot be separated from my fellow men, and it allows me to live, such as I am, on one level with them. It is a means of stirring the greatest number of people by offering them a privileged picture of common joys and sufferings. It obliges the artist not to keep himself apart; it subjects him to the most humble and the most universal truth.

By the same token, the writer's role is not free from difficult duties. By definition he cannot put himself today in the service of those who make history; he is at the service of those who suffer it. Otherwise, he will be alone and deprived of his art. But the silence of an unknown prisoner, abandoned to humiliations at the other end of the world, is enough to draw the writer out of his exile, at least whenever, in the midst of the privileges of freedom, he manages not to forget that silence, and to transmit it in order to make it resound by means of his art.

None of us is great enough for such a task. But in all circumstances of life, in obscurity or temporary fame, cast in the irons of tyranny or for a time free to express himself, the writer can win the heart of a living community that will justify him, on the one condition that he will accept to the limit of his abilities the two tasks that constitute the greatness of his craft: the service of truth and the service of liberty.

Each generation doubtless feels called upon to reform the world. Mine knows that it will not reform it, but its task is perhaps even greater. It consists in preventing the world from destroying itself. Heir to a corrupt history, in which are mingled fallen revolutions, technology gone mad, dead gods, and worn-out ideologies, this generation starting from its own negations has had to re-establish, both within and without, a little of that which constitutes the dignity of life and death."""

VOICE EXPRESSION GUIDE (CRITICAL FOR EMOTIONAL SPEECH SYNTHESIS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The text you write will be converted to speech using ElevenLabs text-to-speech.
To make the voice sound EMOTIONAL and HUMAN (not robotic), use BOTH methods below:

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
METHOD 1: PUNCTUATION (Works with ALL voices - MOST RELIABLE)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ElevenLabs is trained to understand punctuation as emotional cues:

  ?   → Questioning tone, rising intonation at end
        "Have you ever felt truly alive?"
        "What if everything changed... right now?"

  !   → Excitement, urgency, emphasis, increased energy
        "This is your moment!"
        "You are not alone!"
        "Fight for what you believe in!"

  ... → Hesitation, suspense, trailing off, emotional weight
        "And then... everything changed."
        "I never thought... I'd find my way back."
        "Sometimes... we just need to breathe."

  ,   → Natural micro-pauses, pacing, breath points
        "In this moment, right here, you are enough."

  .   → Full stop, finality, letting a thought land
        "This is it. This is your life. Live it."

  —   → Dramatic pause, interruption, emphasis (em dash)
        "You are—and always have been—worthy of love."
        "The truth is—we need each other."

PUNCTUATION EXAMPLES:
  ❌ Flat: "You are capable of amazing things and you should believe in yourself"
  ✅ Alive: "You are capable of amazing things! Do you believe that? You should... because it's true."

  ❌ Flat: "Take a breath and notice how you feel right now"
  ✅ Alive: "Take a breath... Notice how you feel. Right now. In this moment."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
METHOD 2: AUDIO TAGS (Bonus expressiveness for v3 model)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Audio tags are words in [square brackets] that directly control voice emotion.
Place them INLINE, right before the words they should affect.

EMOTIONS (set emotional tone):
  [excited] [sad] [angry] [happy] [fearful] [surprised] [tender] [hopeful]
  [melancholic] [anxious] [peaceful] [passionate] [sorrowful] [joyful]

DELIVERY (control how words are spoken):
  [whispers] [shouts] [softly] [loudly] [urgently] [slowly] [quickly]
  [gently] [firmly] [hesitantly] [confidently] [dramatically]

HUMAN REACTIONS (natural, authentic moments):
  [sighs] [laughs] [chuckles] [gasps] [clears throat] [sniffles]
  [takes a deep breath] [exhales] [pauses to think]

PACING (control rhythm):
  [pause] [long pause] [beat] [silence]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMBINED EXAMPLE (Best Results - Use BOTH Methods Together)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[softly] Welcome to this moment of stillness... [pause]

[takes a deep breath] As you settle in, let the weight of the day begin to lift.
Just for now... you don't have to carry anything.

[tender] You've been through so much, haven't you? [sighs] And yet—here you are.
Still standing. Still hoping. Still trying.

[pause] Do you realize how remarkable that is?

[building excitement] There is something incredible waiting inside you!
Something that has survived every storm... every doubt... every fear!

[whispers] Can you feel it? [long pause]

[passionately] You are not broken! You are not too late! You are exactly where 
you need to be!

[gently] So take another breath... [exhales] And know this:

[tender] You are worthy of love. You always have been. [pause] You always will be.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RULES FOR MAXIMUM EXPRESSION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. USE PUNCTUATION STRATEGICALLY throughout (?, !, ..., —)
2. ADD AUDIO TAGS every 2-3 sentences for emotional shifts
3. VARY your techniques - don't repeat the same pattern
4. USE ELLIPSES (...) for emotional weight and suspense
5. USE QUESTIONS (?) to create intimacy and engagement
6. USE EXCLAMATIONS (!) at emotional peaks
7. COMBINE methods: "[whispers] Do you feel that...?" 
8. BUILD an emotional arc: soft → building → peak → resolution

Audio tags in [square brackets] do NOT count toward your word count.
Use them generously!

# =============================================================================
# TTS TIMING CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# ElevenLabs TTS speaking rate varies by voice, settings, and content type.
#
# PRODUCTION-TESTED VALUES (from ReWire Journey app):
#   - Journey uses 1.7 words per second (WPS) = 102 WPM
#   - This accounts for [pause] tokens, audio tags, natural pauses, emotional delivery
#   - Tested across 1-minute to 10-minute tracks with consistent results
#
# Why 102 WPM works:
#   - Raw ElevenLabs speech: ~150-165 WPM
#   - After [pause] tokens and audio tags: -15-20% time added
#   - Emotional/dramatic pacing: -10-15% slower
#   - Natural sentence pauses: -5-10% added time
#   - Net effective rate: ~100-105 WPM
#
# SAFETY FACTOR:
#   - Set to 1.0 (100%) - speech fills the ENTIRE music duration
#   - No artificial reduction - user controls timing via Speech Entry slider
#   - If user wants speech to start late, they set Speech Entry > 0
# =============================================================================

DEFAULT_TTS_WPM = 102  # Production-tested: 1.7 words per second

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL WORD COUNT REQUIREMENT - YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TARGET: EXACTLY {target_words} WORDS (absolute maximum: {max_words} words)

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE because:
- The text will be converted to speech and mixed with background music
- If you write too many words, the voice will keep talking after the music ends
- If you write too few words, there will be awkward silence

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Write your piece with emotional punctuation (?, !, ...) and audio tags ([excited], [whispers], [pause], [sighs])
2. COUNT EVERY WORD (including small words like "a", "the", "is")
3. Audio tags in [square brackets] do NOT count as words (e.g., [pause], [whispers], [excited], [sighs])
4. If you're over {target_words} words, CUT content until you reach the target
5. If you're under, ADD content until you reach the target

TARGET: {target_words} words = approximately {duration_estimate} of speech

BEFORE YOU FINISH: Count your words one more time. You MUST be between {min_words} and {max_words} words.
Audio tags like [pause], [whispers], [excited], [sighs] are FREE - use them generously for emotional delivery!
